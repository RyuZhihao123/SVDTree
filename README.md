# SVDTree.

This page includes the program and software toolkits for our paper **SVDTree (Accepted by CVPR 2024)**.

## Project Hierarchy:
This project was led by two co-first authors, each responsible for different parts seperately:

üê∂ [**Zhihao Liu**](https://ryuzhihao123.github.io/): mainly handles **``Shape-guided 3D Tree Modeling``** (3D Graphics part), which takes **voxels (point clouds)** as input and produces the final realistic 3D tree models. 

‚Ä¢ ‚≠ê **This is a NEW version: [[a more advanced point-based 3D tree reconstruction software]](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/Point-cloud-3D-tree-reconstruction).** We strongly suggest also trying that new tool, which is more powerful than the one in this repository.

Please refer to Sec.1 for detailed introduction.

üê∂ [**Yuan Li**](): mainly handles the **``Voxel Diffusion Network``** (CNN part), which is trained to generate rough semantic voxels.

‚Ä¢ Please write to him for permission of using his network code.

## Voxel-guided 3D Tree Reconstruction. 

In this section, we released a more adaptable version of our code, that is capable of reconstructing 3D tree structures from **``voxels``** and **``point clouds``**.

Should you have any questions on this part, please feel free to reach out to [**Zhihao Liu**](https://ryuzhihao123.github.io/).

**üî• Please notice that, we now developed [a More Advanced Version](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/Point-cloud-3D-tree-reconstruction) for 3D Tree Reconstruction. We suggest to use that new one for this step.**

### 1.1 - Resources, codes, and demo:


üì∫ **(1) Demo Video:**

 We strongly recommend watching this [[Demo Video]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1htelf6xldyFYocqnZ6rtEZxSvwj3Gy1I/view?usp=sharing) to quickly know about the basic usage of the software.


üü• **(2) Software Download**: 

We have released a compiled exe software that can be directly used without any configuration on Windows PCs. Please download the entire [[this Folder]](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/SVDTree/tree/main/TreeFromPoints_exe) to access the software. Once downloaded, you can easily run the program by simply double-clicking the **``TreeFromPoint.exe``**. 


üìÅ **(3) Source Code**: 

Please check this [[Folder]](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/SVDTree/tree/main/TreeFromPoints_codes) to download the source code.



üü¶ **(4) Test Data of a 3D Point Cloud:**

 You can download **this example 3D point cloud file [[xyz file](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/SVDTree/blob/main/Tree1_input.xyz)]** to quickly have a try with our software. If you would like to generate trees using your own point data, please prepare the file with reference to this format.

### 1.2 - Compile the Source Code:
The **[code](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/SVDTree/tree/main/TreeFromPoints_codes)** for Shape-driven Tree modeling is entirely developed by C++, so you'll need to install the necessary IDE if you want to compile it from scratch.

üìÅ **IDE:**

The IDE I used for programming is [**Qt**](https://download.qt.io/new_archive/qt/5.8/5.8.0/) (qt-opensource-windows-x86-mingw530-5.8.0.exe). 

I highly recommend you to use it as well, since I have successfully compiled my code with it, which can help you avoid many unexpected compilation errors.
Certainly, other IDEs like Visual Studio, are also alternatives.

üìÅ **Compile:** 

You can directly compile in Qt by pressing **``CTRL+R``** after opening the project,

or simply run the following script in the command line:

```cpp
cd ./TreeFromPoints_codes
qmake TreeFromPoints.pro
```

Then, you can find the newly-compiled exe program under path **``./release/``**. and you can activate it easily by clicking it.
