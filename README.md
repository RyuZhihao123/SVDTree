# SVDTree

This repo includes the implementation of the second main step of our paper SVDTree, i.e., to reconstruct 3D tree models from voxels.
This part is entirely implemented by myself so I released it publicly in my own Github.

Not only for our paper, you can use this code to straightly handle the 3D point cloud tree reconstruction.

This part is heavily based on a SIGGRAPH paper (They are not open-source and I guess my implementation is the first shared publicly).
